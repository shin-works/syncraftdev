Stop Saying "Hurry Up." Start Building Independence.

**TimeSense** is a visual timer and voice-guided clock app designed for children ages 4–10 and their families.

With a dual display of an analog learning clock and a visual countdown timer, plus gentle character voice prompts, TimeSense helps kids understand "how much time is left" — without pressure.

Instead of repeatedly saying "Hurry up!",
children begin to move on their own.

TimeSense turns daily routines into calmer, smoother moments for the whole family.

## Why a Voice-Guided Visual Timer Works

Most timers simply beep when time is up.

TimeSense is different.

It provides gentle voice reminders at:

- 45 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 5 minutes
- 1 minute
- Final 10-second countdown

This gradual transition helps children:

- ✔ Prepare mentally
- ✔ Switch activities more smoothly
- ✔ Feel guided rather than rushed

Time becomes something they can understand — not something that suddenly interrupts them.

## Key Features

### Dual Display: Learning Clock + Visual Timer

TimeSense combines an analog clock for learning to tell time with a visual countdown timer that shows remaining time as a circular progress display.

Even children who cannot yet read the clock can intuitively understand how much time remains.

### Gentle Character Voice Prompts

Instead of parents repeating reminders, friendly characters guide children through transitions:

"5 minutes left!"
"Time to get ready for bed!"

Voice prompts can be turned on or off to fit your family's needs.

### Scene-Based Premium Voices

Special voice packs for:

- Morning routines
- Bedtime
- Homework time
- Getting ready to go out

Designed to match real-life daily situations and improve engagement.

## What Parents Are Saying

> ★★★★★ **"Easy to use."**
>
> "I'm a mother of two (ages 5 and 6). The timer can be set in detail, and the simple design makes it easy to use. Instead of a sudden alarm, the 10-second countdown helps my child prepare mentally. We've stopped letting games drag on endlessly."

> ★★★★★ **"Mornings are less stressful."**
>
> "I used to shout 'Hurry up!' every morning. Standard timers felt like I was rushing my child. With this app, the cute characters give the reminders instead, and my kids respond much better. We'll definitely keep using it."
